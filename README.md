## Project 
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Business Contest
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, faces significant revenue losses due to customer churn. Customer acquisition costs are substantially higher than retention costs, making it crucial to identify and retain at-risk customers before they switch to competitors.
## Problem Defination
-The company currently lacks the ability to proactively identify customers who are likely to churn, resulting in:
-Revenue Loss: Customers leaving without warning
-Inefficient Spending: Blanket retention campaigns targeting all customers
-Reactive Approach: Only addressing churn after customers have already left
-Resource Misallocation: Limited retention budget not optimally distributed

## Business Questions
1.What are the strongest predictors of customer churn?
2.Which customers are most likely to churn ?
3.What usage patterns differentiate churners from loyal customers?
## Data Loading and Cleaning
